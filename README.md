# django-docker

This repo has everything you need to develop and deploy Django projects with Docker. It's being actively developed. If there's an improvement you'd like to see, feel free to add an issue or open a pull request.

I've tested this configuration on Mac OS X 10.10.3 and Ubuntu 14.04. It should work equally well on other platforms.

## Get started

First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/). If you're new to Docker, you might also want to check out the [Hello, world! tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerizing/).

Next, clone this repo:

    git@github.com:morninj/django-docker.git

(Mac users should clone it to a directory under `/Users` because of a [Docker bug](https://blog.docker.com/2014/10/docker-1-3-signed-images-process-injection-security-options-mac-shared-directories/) involving Mac shared directories.)
